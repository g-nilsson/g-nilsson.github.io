      <h1>Quantum Circuit Models: A Primer</h1>
      <h2>What are Quantum Circuits?</h2>
      <p>
        A quantum circuit is a network of wires, where we imagine qubits
        traveling around and going through different quantum gates. To
        understand what this actually looks like, it will be much easier to
        first understand probabilistic circuits
      </p>
      <h2>Probabilistic Circuits</h2>
      <p>
        If you've ever drawn a <i>probability</i> tree, you've also drawn a
        probabilistic circuit!
      </p>
      <img
        src="Assets/probability_tree.gif"
        style="float: right; width: 350px; margin: 40px"
      />
      <p>
        For example, if you have a biased coin colored blue and red, landing on
        blue \(60\%\) of the time, and red \(40\%\) of the time. We can describe
        the process of flipping this coin twice using the probability tree to
        the right.<br />
      </p>
      <p>
        We can see how the probability mass progresses through the tree
        (highlighted in green), by multiplying probability mass with the weight
        of each edge it passes over. <br />
      </p>
      <p>
        Let's say we're going to consider it a "win" if we flip different colors
        in our consecutive tosses. We can then get the overall probability of
        "winning" by adding up all the final probability masses that correspond
        to our win scenario, so in this case \(0.24+0.24 = 0.48\).<br />
      </p>
      <p>Let's show you a circuit that models a coin flip!<br /></p>

      <img src="Assets/prob_hadamard.gif" width="350px" class="center" />
      <p>
        In the gif above, we see a setup that has two inputs and two outputs,
        much like how logic gates take in inputs and outputs on circuits As you
        might see, this specific gate gives out \(50\%\) to the top and \(50\%\)
        to the bottom, regardless of the input. This coin-flipping gate actually
        has a name: the Hadamard Gate!
      </p>
      <p>
        Now, I want you to imagine placing two of these in a row so that the
        outputs of the first one map into the input of the next. Stop and
        consider what the output of the second gate should be...
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        After some thinking, it feels natural that the output of the second
        Hadamard gate will also be \(50/50\), since every Hadamard gate outputs
        \(50/50\), regardless of input. We could also come to the same
        conclusion by following the possible paths, and adding up the
        probabilities of each path:
      </p>

      <img src="Assets/two_hadamard_prob.png" width="800px" class="center" />

      <p>
        The picture above shows that if you start at the top input, you have a
        \(50\%\) chance to end up at the top output, which makes sense!<br />
      </p>
      <p>
        Now, we're ready to see how all of this will work when we use quantum
        circuits instead, things are about to get weird.
      </p>

      <h2>Quantum Circuits</h2>
      <p>
        A quantum circuit, is just like a probabilistic circuit, except that the
        edge weights may be complex numbers. Okay, now what does that mean?<br />
      </p>
      <p>Let's remake the Hadamard Gate but in the quantum world.</p>
      <img src="Assets/quantum_hadamard.gif" width="800px" class="center" />
      <p>
        So far, not much has changed. We're still letting our probability values
        traverse the network, multiplying with the weight of each edge as we go.
        Actually, we should call our probability values "probability amplitudes"
        now, because they can be complex or even negative, and they don't need
        to add up to \(1\) anymore. This doesn't make sense for normal
        probabilities. In the very end, we do a special operation \(|x|^2\) on
        our probability amplitudes to get rid of negatives and complex values,
        the result is our unnormalized probability. In the example above, we see
        that the final unnormalized probabilities are equal to each other, which
        is the same result we got in our Hadamard gate before, a \(50/50\)
        outcome if we started at the top input!<br />
      </p>
      <p>
        Also, notice that I've labeled the top input with a \(0\) and the bottom
        one with a \(1\), we can now treat them as bits of input where we either
        input a \(1\) or a \(0\). In the probabilistic world, we start at a
        single point, with the entire probability mass, letting it spread out to
        the different possible outcomes. <br />
      </p>
      <p>
        In the quantum world, we input a qubit and get out a qubit! In the gif
        above, it looks like we have two different inputs and two different
        outputs, but really we're inputting a single qubit (that happens to have
        a \(100\%\) probability to collapse to a \(0\) if we were to observe
        it), and outputting a single qubit (that now has a \(50\%\) chance to
        collapse to a \(0\), and a \(50\%\) chance to collapse to a \(1\), if we
        observe it). We've put our single qubit into a
        <b>superposition</b>!<br />
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        Now let's think, if I connect two of these quantum Hadamard gates in
        series such that the probability amplitudes (the values before we do
        \(|x|^2\)) of \(0\) and \(1\), respectively, get inputted into the
        second Hadamard gate. If I plug in a qubit that is \(100\%\) at \(0\),
        what qubit will I get at the very end?
      </p>
      <img
        src="Assets/hadamard_gates_series.png"
        width="1000px"
        class="center"
      />
      <p>
        Here is when things get funky. We can get the overall probability
        amplitude of a single path by multiplying all the weights of the edges,
        and then performing our operation \(|x|^2\).
        <br />
      </p>
      <p>
        If we look at the top path, we have \(i/2 \times i/2 = -1/4\), which, if
        we plug into our operation we get \(|-1/4|^2=1/16\).<br />
      </p>
      <p>
        If we look at the path that goes from 0, then down in the middle, and
        then up to \(0\) again, we have \(1/2 \times 1/2\) = \(1/4\), which, if
        we plug into our operation we get \(|1/4|^2=1/16\). There's a \(1/16\)
        probability amplitude associated with each path individually.<br />
      </p>
      <p>
        So overall, there are two different valid paths with non-zero
        probabilities. But if we want to calculate the total unnormalized
        probability of going from \(0\) to \(0\) we need to sum the paths'
        probability amplitudes first and then do \(|x|^2\).
      </p>
      <img
        src="Assets/quantum_interference.png"
        width="1000px"
        class="center"
      />
      <p>
        How absurd! There are two different paths, which each have a non-zero
        probability amplitude, but if we take both into consideration they
        cancel each other out!<br />
      </p>
      <p>
        This is <b>quantum interference</b>, just like how waves can interfere
        with each other and cancel out, so can our probability amplitudes.<br />
      </p>

        You can try this out in this quantum circuit simulation from
        <a href="https://thequantumlaend.de/">https://thequantumlaend.de/</a>
        built by the University of Stuttgart.
        <br />
        Remove all but \(1\) of the qubits, then set the system up like the
        pictures below and observe how the histogram on the bottom changes.

      <h2>Benefits (over classical models)</h2>
      <p>
        The question now is, what benefits do these quantum circuit models
        provide? More specifically, why is there so much hype for the use and
        achievability of quantum circuit models? What’s wrong with our classical
        models of computation?
      </p>
      <p>
        In terms of computability, there is actually no difference between the
        functionality of quantum computation models and those of classical
        models, as any problems that can be solved with quantum models can also
        be solved with classical computation models given enough time.
      </p>
      <p>
        The key phrase, however, is “given enough time.” Many computational
        problems that exist in the world today, even though they are
        theoretically solvable by our classical models of computation, are very
        complicated, making them practically impossible to solve. These problems
        (known generally as \(NP\) problems) require so much time to complete
        that they do not make sense to even attempt!
      </p>
      <p>
        This is where quantum circuit models can come into play. These models
        use the principles of quantum mechanics to solve these complicated
        problems with exponentially fewer computational steps than the
        best-known non-quantum algorithms, providing the potential for
        exponential time complexity improvements over classical models! This
        capability, known as “quantum supremacy” is a result of the principles
        of quantum superposition and entanglement, which would, in theory, allow
        quantum computers to explore multiple computational paths
        simultaneously, a property that classical computational models have not
        been able to exhibit. This opens up the potential for tackling
        computationally intensive tasks that were previously infeasible within
        reasonable time frames.
      </p>

      <h2>Examples</h2>
      <p>
        While the concept of quantum supremacy is still under question, there
        has been some progress in quantum algorithms that provide some
        significant time benefits over classical models. One common algorithm is
        Shor’s algorithm, which is used for integer factorization. The
        best-known classical algorithm for solving this problem requires
        super-polynomial time. However, with the quantum benefits of Shor’s
        algorithm, this can be completed in polynomial time, representing a
        significant time reduction from classical algorithms.
      </p>
      <p>
        Another example of this is Grover’s algorithm, for finding marked
        elements in an unstructured database. For a database with N elements, a
        linear search would normally take \(O(N)\) time (an order of \(N\)
        evaluations, for each element in the database) to find marked elements.
        Grover’s algorithm requires just \(O(\sqrt{N})\) time, providing a
        quadratic speedup for the problem, especially for larger database sizes.
      </p>
      <p>
        These quantum algorithms, as well as the overall current level of
        progress made in quantum computing research, show the compelling
        potential to revolutionize the field of computational theory.
      </p>

      <h2>P = NP?</h2>
      <p>
        The discussion of time complexities brings us to the ongoing \(P = NP\)
        debate. The debate questions whether the set of \(P\) problems -
        problems that can be solved in polynomial time; relatively quickly - is
        equal to the set of \(NP\) problems - problems that can be verified in
        polynomial time, but can take longer (possibly exponentially longer)
        time to solve. In other words, can all those tough \(NP\) problems be
        cracked just as quickly as the relatively easier \(P\) problems?
      </p>
      <p>
        How is the field of quantum computation relevant to this debate? Quantum
        computing doesn't give us a straightforward answer, but it does shake
        things up. While classical computers might struggle with \(NP\)
        problems, quantum computers could potentially zip through them (thanks
        to their unique abilities of superposition and entanglement!).
